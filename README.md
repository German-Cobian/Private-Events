# Private-Events

This app is an exercise in the main concepts of Associations in Rails (mimicks the main features of Eventbrite).

![Enter-post](/app/assets/images/Enter-post.png?raw=true "Enter post")

The landing page ( `http://localhost:3000/` ) displays the list of all events, categorized as "Upcoming" or "Past".

![Landing page](/app/assets/images/Landing-page.png?raw=true "Landing page")

Links in the nav bar allow users to sign-Up, log-In, and view all posted events. 

When Logged-in, a user can access private pages to create events,

![Create event](/app/assets/images/Create-event.png?raw=true "Create event")

and to view events he/she is hosting, is enrolled in and are upcoming, or was enrolled in and have already taken place.

![Event enrolled](/app/assets/images/Event-enrolled.png?raw=true "Event enrolled in")

After an event is successfully created, the user gets redirected to the event's show page. The user can then invite other users to events he/she is hosting. Only upcoming events show the option to invite other users.

![Invite](/app/assets/images/Invite.png?raw=true "Invite")

The invited user has the option to accept the invitation, and so, enroll in the event, or to ignore it.

![Enroll in event](/app/assets/images/Enroll-in-event.png?raw=true "Enroll in event")

Users have the option to uninvite to events they are hosting,

![Invitation cancel](/app/assets/images/Invitation-cancel.png?raw=true "Invitation cancel")

and to unenroll from events they had signed-up for. 

![Event-cancel](/app/assets/images/Event-cancel.png?raw=true "Event cancel")
